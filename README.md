üëã Hello! Welcome to my Github profile.


## My name is Jos√© de Castre and my nickname is "Jos√© DCastro"!

**Jos√© DCastro/Jos√© DCastro** is a special repository!

Firstly, I would like to thank you for visiting my portfolio, it is always good to meet new peopl



I am currently studying the 3rd semester of the Systems Analysis and Development course at Faculdade Anhanguera, with this I have sought to learn beyond the walls of the Faculty, and that is why I am taking some courses in parallel seeking to expand my knowledge and start some study and personal projects.
Because of this, I am starting the development of a Store Manager with some specifications such as: registration of sellers, Products, stock control, sales management, printing of weekly and monthly reports... using Python, Qt6 and Maria DB Database .


As inspiration, I started a project aimed at educational assistance for children with Autism Spectrum and Down Syndrome, which will not only help teachers and speech therapists in speaking, but also in personal communication and socialization. This project began as a course completion work, but since its beginning there was already a desire to expand the project, which is now being supported by CIAM (Centro Israelita de Apoio Multidisciplinar).
All of its content will be developed in Python, SQL, AI, among other tools.


Once you have completed each one, I will make the codes available here for anyone who wants to access them.

Caso se interesse em participar de algum desses projetos √© s√≥ buscar contato comigo e conversaremos.

Meu objetivo √© a especializa√ß√£o em FullStack voltado para Desktop, controle e gerenciamento em Db e cria√ß√£o web.
Para isso, inicialmente estou focando no estudo em Python, Java, JavaScript, Css, HTML, React.Js e Nodes.Js. Al√©m de PHP, PostegreSQL e MariaDB. Claro que tudo com calma e dedica√ß√£o para que n√£o haja perda de tempo e sim aprimoramento.
